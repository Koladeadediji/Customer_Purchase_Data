# Customer_Purchase_Data
## Introduction

In this project, I  focused on analysing the consumer purchase based on certain given features. The dataset contains valuable information about key parameters about Purchases details. The objective of this project is to extract insights from the data to make inform decison-making about purchases made by different individuals of different age, sex and many more and predict how the behaviour of the purchase data could look like. 
## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from kaggle data catalogue, accesible at the following link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-customer-purchase-behavior-dataset

## Data Processing

### Importing Data

I started by importing the dataset from the source. The data contains columns for several columns like Age, Gender, Annual Income, Number of Purchases, Product Category, Time Spent On Website, Loyalty Website, Discount Availed, Purchases Status

### Data Cleaning and Transformation 
I performed Data cleaning and transformation to ensure the consistency of the dataset. This includes removing empty columns to make sure I am not processing a zero data, ensuring there's no outlier, also ensuring there's no duplicate data and the data was ready for processing.

 ### Analysis and Insights 
I conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to extract meaningful insights that could aid decision -making. This includes showing plots to better understand such as:

- Count of Males and Females represented in the data
- Distribution of the product category
- Distribution of Purchase Status by Gender 
- Number of Purchases by Gender 
- The best machine language model for the data 
 

## Summary and Findings
 The Project findings are documented in the `customer_purchase_data.pdf` file. This include a narrative of the insights and findings on the dataset and how the machine language model which was the best suitable for the dataset

 ## Acknowledgments

  I will like to thank Kaggle for making this data available ,which serves as a foundation for this analysis
